# Code Examples
This function takes two numbers as parameters, the first number being the coefficient, and the second number being the exponent.

Your function should multiply the two numbers, and then subtract 1 from the exponent. Then, it has to print out an expression (like 28x^7). "^1" should not be truncated when exponent = 2.
```
def derive(coefficient, exponent):
    if exponent != 1 and exponent != 0 and coefficient != 0:
        a = str(coefficient * exponent)
        b = str(exponent - 1)
        multiply = (a + 'x^' + b)
        return multiply
```
